# Rustep - Rust Executable Parser
A executable parser written in Rust, currently in heavy devlopment.

# Current Progress
I just implemented support for ELF files, but I'm gonna beautify it since the two layer design is
kind of overkill for this simple process which can fully apply `nom` crate to it.

But anyway, the ELF support is done.
