# 0.1.1 ~ 0.1.2
* [x] avoid the duplicate code of elf parsers when dealing with two versions of elf format 
* [x] use trait as the main interface of the structure instead of access the data directly. (Partially done. Elf header and elf itself not complete.)

# 0.1.2 ~ 0.1.3
* [ ] provide more information from ELF(got table, symbol table, etc.)
